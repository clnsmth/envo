# Skill: Mapping EDI Annotation Studio Term Requests to ENVO Schema

This skill defines the workflow and mapping rules for converting a "New term request received by the EDI annotation studio" into a standard "ENVO new term request" format.

## Triggering Condition
This workflow is triggered when a human curator mentions the agent on a GitHub issue containing an EDI-formatted term request, asking using any natural variation of:
`@clnsmth-ontology-agent please map this to the ENVO new term request` or `@clnsmth-ontology-agent please map this`.

The agent should recognize semantic variations such as:
- "map this"
- "convert to ENVO request"
- "translate this to ENVO schema"
- "format for ENVO"

## Input Format (EDI Annotation Studio Request)
The issue body typically contains the following markdown structure:
```markdown
# Proposed Ontology Term

### Suggested Term Name
[Suggested Term Name]

### Description
[Textual Description]

### Reference / Source
[Reference URL, PMID, or DOI]

### GitHub Username
@[Username]

### ORCID URL
[ORCID URL]

### Attribution Consent
[Attribution Consent Statement]
```

## Mapping & Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Fields and Fill Blanks
Carefully parse and extract fields from the issue body:
- `SUGGESTED_NAME`: Extract from `### Suggested Term Name`
- `DESCRIPTION`: Extract from `### Description`
- `REFERENCE`: Extract from `### Reference / Source`
- `CREATOR_ORCID`: Extract from `### ORCID URL`
- `CREATOR_GITHUB`: Extract from `### GitHub Username`

**Handling Missing Information**:
If any required information is missing, the agent MUST do its best to fill in the blanks proactively:
1. **Missing Name**: Halt and request clarification.
2. **Missing Description**: Attempt to query Wikipedia or search the web using the term name to draft a plausible definition.
3. **Missing Reference**: Do NOT perform complex academic/literature database searches (like PubMed or DOI) to retrieve peer-reviewed articles. Peer-reviewed literature is NOT a requirement. Simply output a direct URL to the specific Wikipedia page (e.g., `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_Name`) or specific glossary/scientific article page where the definition actually exists.
   - **NO SEARCH ENGINES**: General search engine query links (such as Google search results) are NOT valid citations. The URL must link directly to the page containing the content.
   - **URL VERIFICATION CHECK**: You MUST verify that any reference URL or DOI you fetch or use actually resolves and is an active, live webpage (i.e. does not return a 404, bad gateway, or unresolvable domain). If a URL is broken or unresolvable, you must search for and select an alternative valid, active URL.
4. **Missing ORCID**: Look up the GitHub user's public profile or use a placeholder, clearly flagging that the ORCID must be updated by the curator.
5. **Always flag any filled-in blanks** at the end of the post so curators are aware of what was inferred.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Formatting Overrides**:
> - **NEVER output the local GitHub issue thread URL** in the 'Term Tracker Item' field. You must ALWAYS output exactly the literal string: `[To be filled in with the ENVO issue URL]` on this line.
> - **NEVER perform scholarly PMID/DOI database searches** for missing references, and NEVER use search engine results pages as citations. Only output verified, active links to specific pages.

### Step 2: Check for Existing Terms (Duplicate Check)
Leverage existing local OAK search strategies:
```bash
runoak -i sqlite:src/envo/envo.db search "<SUGGESTED_NAME>"
```
Also search for alternative phrasings and lowercase variations.

- **IF EXACT MATCH IS FOUND**:
  Stop and report back immediately by posting a comment to the issue thread:
  ```markdown
  🤖 **Concept Already Exists**
  
  The term **<SUGGESTED_NAME>** already exists in the Environment Ontology.
  - **Ontology ID**: `ENVO:XXXXXXX` (replace with actual ID)
  - **Label**: `[Matched Term Label]`
  - **Definition**: `[Matched Term Definition]`
  
  No further mapping was performed.
  ```

### Step 3: Suggest Parent Classes
If the term does NOT exist, search ENVO for potential parent terms using OAK search to provide the curator with candidates:
```bash
runoak -i sqlite:src/envo/envo.db search "<keyword from SUGGESTED_NAME or DESCRIPTION>"
```
Identify 1-3 candidate parent classes and their IDs.

### Step 4: Formulate the OBO-Compliant Definition
Formulate a first-pass definition in the standard ENVO genus-differentia format:
- **Format**: `A [Suggested Parent Class] which [Description's differentiating features].`
- Follow these guidelines:
  1. Ensure the parent class is an actual, lowercase ENVO class label.
  2. Correct minor spelling/grammatical issues in the description (e.g. mapping "mater" to "matter").
  3. Ensure it starts with the standard indefinite article (`A` or `An`).
  4. **Strict Source Coupling**: The textual definition and the cited reference URL MUST be tightly coupled. The generated textual definition MUST be derived directly and exclusively from the content of the single specific webpage whose URL is used in the 'Definition Source / Reference' field. Never mix information from multiple sources, and never cite a different webpage than the one from which the definition was formulated.

### Step 5: Post copy-pasteable ENVO New Term Request
Post a beautifully formatted markdown comment containing the final ENVO issue template format. This must be formatted exactly as a standard upstream ENVO new term request, so curators can copy and paste it directly:

```markdown
🤖 **Mapped ENVO New Term Request**

I have successfully mapped the EDI annotation studio term request to the standard ENVO new term request schema! 

You can copy and paste the markdown block below directly into a new issue on the upstream official ENVO ontology repository:

```markdown
# New Term Request: <SUGGESTED_NAME in lowercase>

- **Preferred Term Label**: <SUGGESTED_NAME in lowercase>
- **Textual Definition**: A [Suggested Parent Class] which [differentia based on Description].
- **Parent Class (Position in Hierarchy)**: [Suggested Parent Class] ([ENVO ID])
- **Definition Source / Reference**: <REFERENCE>
- **Exact Synonym(s)**: [Optional - list exact synonyms if any]
- **Created By**: <CREATOR_ORCID>
- **Creation Date**: <CURRENT_ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP>
- **Term Tracker Item**: [To be filled in with the ENVO issue URL]
```

*Note on filled-in/inferred information:*
- [List any fields that were missing and filled/inferred by the agent, or 'None' if all were present in the source]
